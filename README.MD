1.How does regularization prevent overfitting?
Regularization mitigates overfitting by introducing a cost when the algorithm becomes excessively sophisticated. This compels the model to maintain a more straightforward decision boundary and steer clear of capturing random fluctuations in the training dataset. A more streamlined model tends to perform better on novel data. For instance, in Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines (SVM), a lower value of C implies tougher regularization, resulting in gentler boundaries and reduced overfitting

2.When to choose ensemble methods versus basic algorithms?
Basic algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, or Perceptron) are advantageous when the data collection is modest in size, well-structured, and largely linearly distinguishable. These models are straightforward to configure, quicker to execute, and more transparent in terms of interpretation.
Ensemble techniques (like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting Machines) are preferable when the dataset is extensive, messy, or nonlinear in nature. They aggregate several models, typically yielding enhanced precision and minimizing prediction mistakes, though they tend to be less intuitive to understand.
General guideline: Begin with basic models, and transition to ensemble strategies if the data is intricate or if performance falls short.
